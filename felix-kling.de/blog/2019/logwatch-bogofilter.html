<h1>Logwatch filter for Bogofilter</h1>
<p>I recently setup my own email server and use
<a href="http://bogofilter.sourceforge.net/">bogofilter</a> for spam classification. I
also use <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/logwatch/">logwatch</a> to monitor my
server. Previously I was using <a href="https://spamassassin.apache.org/">spamassassin</a>
for another email setup and I liked how logwatch would show me how many emails
spamassassin classified as spam or ham. I wanted the same for bogofilter but
logwatch doesn&#8217;t support it out of the box, at least not the version I was
using.</p>
<p>However, adding custom log filters is quite easy. There might be a better or
more correct way to do it but the following worked for me.</p>
<h2 id="the-log-file">
The log file <a href="logwatch-bogofilter.html#the-log-file">#</a>
</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m running Debian on my server and bogofilter logs information about
classifying emails as well as training spam and ham to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/var/log/mail.log</code>.<br/>
Here are some examples (date and host name omitted).</p>
<p>Classification:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bogofilter[10295]: X-Bogosity: Ham, spamicity=0.0000, version=1.2.4
bogofilter[10453]: X-Bogosity: Unsure, spamicity=0.9837, version=1.2.4
bogofilter[10617]: X-Bogosity: Spam, spamicity=1.0000, version=1.2.4
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Training:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bogofilter[23768]: register-n, 1550 words, 1 messages
bogofilter[11794]: register-s, 874 words, 1 messages
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">register-n</code> means that the message was learned as ham.</p>
<h2 id="logwatch-script-and-configuration">
Logwatch script and configuration <a href="logwatch-bogofilter.html#logwatch-script-and-configuration">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Custom logwatch filters can be added to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/logwatch/conf/services/</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/logwatch/scripts/services/</code> (paths might be different in other
distributions). By default logwatch uses all filters, so there is nothing else
that needs to be setup besides a configuration file for our new filter and the
filter script itself.</p>
<p>Since this is a very simple script with no options, the configuration file just
provides the name the filter and which logfile to analyze:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt"># /etc/logwatch/conf/services/bogofilter.conf
Title = "Bogofilter"
LogFile = maillog
</code></pre>
<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">maillog</code> is defined somehow and somewhere else. I found out about this by
looking at existing email related filters.</p>
<p>logwatch will provide the log file via standard input to our filter. Most
built-in filters are written in perl, but since I don&#8217;t know perl and since the
language doesn&#8217;t seem to matter, I wrote a shell script utilizing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">awk</code>
instead:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># /etc/logwatch/services/bogofilter</span>
<span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>

<span class="nb">awk</span> <span class="s1">'
  !/bogofilter/ { next; }

  /X-Bogosity: Ham,/ {
    Ham += 1
  }
  /X-Bogosity: Spam,/ {
    Spam += 1
  }
  /X-Bogosity: Unsure,/ {
    Unsure += 1
  }

  /register-s/ {
    if (match($0, /[0-9][0-9]* messages/) != 0) {
      split(substr($0, RSTART, RLENGTH), parts, " ")
      SpamLearned += parts[1]
    }
  }

  /register-n/ {
    if (match($0, /[0-9][0-9]* messages/) != 0) {
      split(substr($0, RSTART, RLENGTH), parts, " ")
      HamLearned += parts[1]
    }
  }

  END {
    if (Ham + Spam + Unsure &gt; 0) {
      printf "Total Messages: %d\n", Ham + Spam + Unsure
      printf "  Ham: %d\n", Ham
      printf "  Spam: %d\n", Spam
      printf "  Unsure: %d\n\n", Unsure
    }

    printf "Learned as spam: %d\n", SpamLearned
    printf "Learned as ham: %d\n", HamLearned
  }
'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This simple counts the number of spams, hams, unsures, and learnings, and
prints a summary that looks like this:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> Total Messages: 32
   Ham: 21
   Spam: 2
   Unsure: 9

 Learned as spam: 2
 Learned as ham: 0
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Built-in scripts are more complex since they often support options and print
different output depending on the configured level of detail. But this script
was all I needed.</p>
