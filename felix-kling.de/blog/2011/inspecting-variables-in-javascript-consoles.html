<h1>Inspecting variables in JavaScript consoles - Timing is important</h1>
<p>Already a while back, there was an interesting question on Stack Overflow
(I will link to it if I find it).</p>
<p>It was about logging objects which got populated by an Ajax callback.
Now we all know that the code that immediately follows the Ajax call is
executed <strong>before</strong> the response callback is executed:</p>
<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Using jQuery only as example</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{};</span>                     <span class="c1">// 1</span>
<span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kd">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">/some/url</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>   <span class="c1">// 2</span>
    <span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">bar</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">;</span>              <span class="c1">// 5</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">);</span>                 <span class="c1">// 3</span>
<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">foo</span><span class="p">);</span>             <span class="c1">// 4</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The questioner&#8217;s problem was that the output from the line marked with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4</code> was
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">undefined</code> but the object logged one line before clearly showed that it
has the property <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-going-on-here">
What is going on here? <a href="inspecting-variables-in-javascript-consoles.html#what-is-going-on-here">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The problem was that the console does not actually show the whole object, but
only a line with a handle to inspect it further, something like this
(the pictures are showing the Chrome console) :</p>
<p><img src="../../images/console_1.png" alt="Console 1" /></p>
<p>Only <strong>after</strong> clicking the arrow, you can see the object&#8217;s structure:</p>
<p><img src="../../images/console_2.png" alt="Console 2" /></p>
<p>This made me think and a small experiment confirmed my assumption:</p>
<p>When you click on the handle, it does not show the content of the object
at the time when it was logged, but the content it has <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>You can try it yourself (this is even more mysterious as FireBug shows
the current content immediately):</p>
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="https://jsfiddle.net/fkling/9SE7r/embedded/result,js">&nbsp;</iframe>
<p>Back to the Ajax situation: The questioners problem was that at time he clicked the handle
to inspect the contents, the Ajax call already returned, giving him the impression that he
actually has access to the properties in the code following the call.</p>
<p>What do we learn from that? Don&#8217;t trust every output :)</p>
